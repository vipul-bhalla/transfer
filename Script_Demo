Imagine this scenario: a finance executive comes to you with a critical request — they need a comprehensive profit and loss statement for the bank, covering all lines of business. Traditionally, this would involve mobilizing a team of 100 to 200 analysts who would have to manually extract data from different business units, consolidate it, and present a unified statement. This process can take days, if not weeks. And, if a follow-up question is asked — say, to drill down into specific areas like the profitability of retail banking versus corporate banking — the entire process restarts, leading to significant lead times and resource costs.

This manual, time-consuming approach is not just inefficient but can delay strategic decision-making, especially in a fast-paced financial environment."

[Proposed Solution]
"To address this challenge, we are excited to present an Interactive Natural Language Query Engine that leverages advanced AI capabilities to transform how we access financial data. With this solution, finance executives can simply ask questions like 'What is the overall profit or loss made by the bank across all lines of business?' and receive an accurate, summarized response within minutes.

Ease of Use: No more navigating through dashboards or generating reports manually. Simply type your question, and the system provides a summarized analysis in plain English.

However, I want to be transparent about the current limitations. The solution is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), which, while highly capable, can sometimes produce outputs that may be inaccurate or based on hallucinated data points. Therefore, the results should not be blindly trusted, especially for critical decision-making. We recommend a human-in-the-loop process to validate key insights before they are acted upon

To sum it up, this tool has the potential to revolutionize how we approach financial data analysis by drastically reducing time and resources spent on data consolidation and reporting. Imagine empowering your finance teams to move from data collection to strategic decision-making within minutes, not days.

We believe this solution can become a cornerstone for driving efficiency and agility in our financial operations. I’m excited to demonstrate how it works in real-time, and I’m confident that this could be a transformative step forward for our bank."

"Thank you for your time, and I’m looking forward to your feedback after the demo.
