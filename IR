Handling Structured Data (Tables, Sections)
Scalability for Large Document Collections
State-of-the-Art Information Retrieval Techniques
Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of modern IR techniques that would work well for your use case:

1. Dense Retrieval Using Embeddings
Instead of traditional keyword matching, dense retrieval techniques use embeddings to retrieve semantically relevant documents.

Approach:
Convert queries and document sections into embeddings using models like:
BERT-based models (e.g., MS MARCO, ColBERT, SBERT)
OpenAI's ada-002 or Google's Gemini API
Store embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Milvus, Weaviate).
Perform similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity, inner product) to retrieve the best-matching sections.
Advantages:
âœ” Contextual retrieval (understands intent, not just keywords)
âœ” Handles synonyms, paraphrased queries well

Implementation:
Convert each section of your HTML/XML into a structured format (e.g., JSON)
Index embeddings of each section in a vector store.
For a query, retrieve the top-k closest sections.
2. Hybrid Search (BM25 + Embeddings)
Combining BM25 (traditional retrieval) with Dense Retrieval improves accuracy.

Approach:
BM25 (Lexical Matching)
Index text-based sections using Elasticsearch or Vespa.
Perform keyword-based ranking.
Semantic Search (Embeddings)
Use a Transformer model to retrieve relevant sections based on meaning.
Re-rank results:
Use cross-attention models (e.g., MonoT5, ColBERT) to improve ranking.
Advantages:
âœ” Improved precision by capturing both lexical + semantic relevance
âœ” Works well for long documents

Implementation:
Use BM25 as a fast initial retrieval.
Re-rank with BERT/Transformer models.
3. Table-Aware Retrieval
Many procedures contain tabular data, which should be retrieved intelligently.

Techniques:
TAPAS (Table Parsing using BERT) â†’ Helps understand table structure + content.
Structure-Aware Retrieval:
Convert tables to text (flatten rows/columns).
Encode table headers and values separately.
Use Tree-based Retrieval (e.g., graph embeddings).
Implementation:
Extract tables from HTML/XML and store them as structured data.
Use Transformer models like TAPAS to retrieve based on user queries.
4. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for Query Expansion
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval + generative models to refine results.

Approach:
Retrieve top-k relevant sections from a vector database.
Use a LLM (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4, LLaMA) to summarize, expand or filter results.
Use query expansion techniques to improve retrieval.
Advantages:
âœ” Handles ambiguous queries by reformulating them
âœ” Generates precise, contextual answers

Implementation:
Store HTML/XML embeddings in a vector DB.
Retrieve and pass the top relevant sections to an LLM.
Generate a summary or answer based on the documents.
5. Multi-Modal Retrieval (Text + Tables + Metadata)
For structured HTML/XML documents, multi-modal search can improve accuracy.

Approach:
Extract different document sections:
Headers, tables, paragraphs, metadata
Encode them using different models:
Text â†’ BERT-based models
Tables â†’ TAPAS, TaBERT
Metadata â†’ Use structured indices (SQL, Graph DB)
Combine scores from different modalities.
Implementation:
Store structured data in SQL/GraphDB.
Use multi-modal embeddings to retrieve relevant sections.
