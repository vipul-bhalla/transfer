The code you shared initially should largely remain unchanged after updating the BigQuery data with a defined schema. However, there are a few minor adjustments you might need to make to ensure that the code correctly handles the updated data. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

Key Considerations:
Column Names: Ensure that the code uses the correct column names in SQL queries and when processing query results.
Data Handling: Verify that the data is being handled correctly in the function, especially when retrieving and processing results from BigQuery.
Changes to the Existing Code:
Update SQL Query Construction:

If your queries were previously relying on the default column names like f0_, f1_, etc., you need to update them to use the newly defined schema's column names.
For example, if your CSV previously had unnamed columns and you’ve now named them order_id, product_name, etc., update the queries accordingly.
python
Copy code
# Example update in your `sql_query_func`
sql_query_func = FunctionDeclaration(
    name="sql_query",
    description="Get information from data in BigQuery using SQL queries",
    parameters={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "query": {"type": "string", "description": "SQL query on a single line that will help give quantitative answers to the user's question when run on a BigQuery dataset and table. In the SQL query, always use the fully qualified dataset and table names."}
        },
        "required": ["query"],
    },
)
In the handle_user_prompt function, ensure that queries use the correct column names:
python
Copy code
if response.function_call.name == "sql_query":
    cleaned_query = params["query"].replace("\\n", " ").replace("\n", "").replace("\\", "")
    query_job = client.query(cleaned_query, job_config=job_config)
    api_response = query_job.result()
    print("sql query func:", api_response)
    api_response = str([dict(row) for row in api_response])
    api_response = api_response.replace("\\", "").replace("\n", "")
    api_requests_and_responses.append([response.function_call.name, params, api_response])
Result Handling:

When processing the api_response after a SQL query, ensure that the code correctly accesses the data using the new column names.
For example, if you are retrieving order_id, ensure that your code is accessing row["order_id"] and not row["f0_"].
python
Copy code
if response.function_call.name == "sql_query":
    job_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(maximum_bytes_billed=100000000)
    try:
        cleaned_query = params["query"].replace("\\n", " ").replace("\n", "").replace("\\", "")
        query_job = client.query(cleaned_query, job_config=job_config)
        api_response = query_job.result()

        # Ensure correct access to the columns
        api_response = str([{"order_id": row["order_id"], "quantity": row["quantity"]} for row in api_response])

        print("sql query func:", api_response)
        api_response = api_response.replace("\\", "").replace("\n", "")
        api_requests_and_responses.append([response.function_call.name, params, api_response])
    except Exception as e:
        api_response = f"{str(e)}"
        api_requests_and_responses.append([response.function_call.name, params, api_response])
Testing:

Test the entire flow after these changes to ensure that the prompts are being handled correctly, and the data returned from BigQuery is as expected.
Summary:
The main structure of the handle_user_prompt function remains unchanged.
Ensure that any SQL queries and result handling in the code are updated to reflect the new column names and data types defined in your updated BigQuery schema.
Thoroughly test the code to confirm that it handles the data correctly without any errors.
